This is an illustration of the branching and merging of what happens when the
git pull origin master is executed

## Q4

No, the command just added the data from master to my local.

## Q5

This is a merge because a rebase adds on branch data to the end of a 
sequence and then deletes the branch, while our branch is still intact, 
because the two different branches were preserved in version control history. 

## Q6 

The local master branch is still behind the remote master.

## Q7

No, the remote branch was removed without any effect on the local version
 of JeremyBranch.
